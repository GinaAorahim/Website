<p><h1> Greetings visitor.</h1></p>
<p>
 I used the tag title to make the tab display "my webpage", super cool. with my body tag, i typed this up to display this text and everything you will see will stay int he body text. <br>I used bold tag (b) to display <b> bold </b> 	or even strong bold for, <strong> strong bold </strong>. <br></p>

<p><a> google.com</a></p>
we used an a tag (a tag in html is the hyperlink tag) that is used for a hyperlink, but it is not filled in correctly.  dont forget the href!. V <br>
<a href="https://www.google.com/"> google link here :) </a>
<br>img src= '' is to display an image ! bonus if you can figure out how to display an image with a link. 
<br><img src="https://cdn2-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2018/10/puppies-cover.jpg">

<p>if you figured out how to display an image with a link , good job. here's how I did it. </p>

<a href=" https://www.google.com/"><img src=" https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/sgp-catalog-images/region_US/qez76-6BT7VM62R9N-Full-Image_GalleryBackground-en-US-1579724205743._SX1080_.jpg"></a>
 <p>you put the lime in the coconut first.  kidding, you use the a tag and follow with the img src tag. :) <br> so i will look like a href = with the link  to hwere you want us to go  end with a tag then start a new tag (no spaces) with img src = with the link  of the image you picked and  close that tab <br> and save, reload your website.  </p>
<p> br tag is a line break. thats why it starts at a new line after my smiley face. </p>

br is how you can structure content added in html so it doesnt just contnue on and on an on  on this one line. 
<p>the paragraph tag is used for fresh line breaks. . this line is used with a p tag. </p>
this text will be used wit ha line break. <br> 
wow the difference with the spacing!..  goodjob. 


Doctype html declares its an html, it is a good rule of thumb to just add it in. 

Below is a list i made  through html. <em> my god, how cool </em>
<ul>
	<li>  item 1</li>
	<li> item 2 </li>
	<li> ul tag is  unordered so it will display bullet points. thsi tag can be repeated. </li>
</ul>

div tag is a style tag!  it is used alot, but for this html portion, I wont use it. 

 so with html = 
 <ul>
 	<li> it uses <> tags. </li>
 	<li> html wont know what you want it to do without the tags. </li>
 	<li> four main tags are !doctype html,  html, head, and body tags that are needed to begin using html. </li>
 	<li> meep</li>
 	<li> it doesnt recognize anything unless you have tags. </li>
 	<li> paragraph tags give a fresh seperated text, its better than line break. </li>
 	<li> br tag has no /br tag because its just a line break, and the code is smart enough to  know this</li>
 	<li><h1> header tags are up to 6 . h1 is biggest to show its most important.</h1></li>
 	<li><h2> no comprehendo? heres h2</h2></li>
 	<li><h3> ahhh you  got it now. </h3></li>
 	<li><h4> now? </h4></li>
 	<li><h5> okay youre good </h5></li>
 	<li><h6> eeekk, h6 just in case, by teh way, i put the closed h6 after the li tag, and it messed up, so used the header tag to close first :) </h6></li>
 	<li> there are only a few html tags to learn and youre good.</li>
 </ul>
 All the html that i used is from  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JluqTojuME&index=1&list=PLoYCgNOIyGAB_8_iq1cL8MVeun7cB6eNc"> this site</a> to cover all this. if you learned or know how to do this all, youre alread ya professional with html (yay :).
