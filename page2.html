 <h2> This is page 2 content. to show the CSS ive done.its all about style, style, style! did you notice i have gray in the backgroudn?</h2>
 <p> all my page 2 content will be here</p>
 <p> look, my text has abackground color with a different text color!! , i used my css style to make a rule that all the properties with a p tag will display white text,<br> wit ha dark gray background and a padding. paddding is having space around the text. </p>
<br> i also made my links the color purple :D 
<br> and text wit h1 and h2 are gray. 
<br> these text arent being applied to because i ussed the break line tag  and didnt tell my css to change anything with it. 


<br> but what if  i want to change the color of just one paragraph? 
<br> i gotchu. Use the class style. class will give a rule to a name, and that name can be put in the tag so the rule is applied to that tag. targeting any html with the<br> class' identifying name to be that rule. 
<br> you can override your rules as your go on. but class is so specific it is not overridden, and applies to many tags if you want to. 
<br>
<br> ID tags: 
<p id= "special"> this is an id tag that is special because id is only used once</p>
<br> Using Class:
<p class= "secondary"> this text is tagged with a p tag and inside the p tag is a class id'd as seconary, so its style will change to the rules i've given the class "secondary
</p>
<br> text i've applied to ALL of the body content (the whole site):
<p> normal text wit ha p tag with my css rule</p>
<br>see the difference? check out dev tools to see the addons  in the tag
